/**
 * @brief The GroupLayer class
 * A group layer is a layer that can contain other layers.
 * In Krita, layers within a group layer are composited
 * first before they are added into the composition code for where
 * the group is in the stack. This has a significant effect on how
 * it is interpreted for blending modes.
 *
 * PassThrough changes this behaviour.
 *
 * Group layer cannot be animated, but can contain animated layers or masks.
